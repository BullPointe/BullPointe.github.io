user_description: I am a senior at Rutgers Preparatory High School. Iâ€™m involved and interested in research projects in science and technology. My interests are primarily focused on computer applications that aid in scientific research. I love to play soccer throughout the year.  In my free time I develop software, varying from genome reconstruction to simple implementations of algorithms.
