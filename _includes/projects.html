        The research involves metagenomics, the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. Extracted DNA from these samples are cloned into BAC, or bacterial artificial chromosome vectors and put through Anti-Microbial screening to identify new antibiotics present in the extremely competitive environment. Using metagenomics and next generation sequencing (NGS) to target a specific region of the microbial 16S ribosomal RNA genes are implemented to identify and quantify the bacteria present in soil samples collected from campus environment.

        The research involves growing an individual bacterial colony containing certain engineered plasmids, that enclose inserts that can be identified by selectable markers. Successfully conducted research on the proteins in depth function, process, and its impact in Landoltia Punctata. Submitted multiple DNA sequences to the <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">NCBI.gov</a> database.

      <h5> Weather Smart Music Search </h5>
      <li> Developed in Java</li>
      <p style="padding-right:10px" align="justify">
        Developed an application that generates a list of music to listen based on the weather in the user’s current location. The music list is generated from the ITunes API. The application also implements YouTube functionality, allowing the user to listen to their created playlist. Incorporates REST API’s in order to get user’s location, current weather, and music list.
